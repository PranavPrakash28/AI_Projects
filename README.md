# AI_Projects

In this project, I created a custom dataset to analyze and predict student exam outcomes based on their study habits and attendance patterns.

Techniques Used:
Linear Regression: To predict the final exam score of a student based on the number of hours studied.

Logistic Regression: To classify whether a student will pass or fail, using study time and attendance as features.

K-Means Clustering: To group students into clusters based on similar behavior (e.g., high attendance + low study time, etc.) and understand the characteristics of each group.

Key Features:
Self-created, realistic dataset with features like:

Hours_Studied

Attendance_Rate

Exam_Score

Pass/Fail outcome

Applied exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations to understand the data.

Built and evaluated machine learning models using scikit-learn.

Interpreted model results to gain insight into how study time and attendance impact student success.
